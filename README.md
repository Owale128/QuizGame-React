# Quiz Game (React) ðŸ˜ƒ

This is a web application that allows users to play a question quiz. It keeps track of questions, user answers, scores and displays results. Additionally, users can enter their name before starting the game. The code also includes functions to restart or exit the quiz and display a list of the highest scores. There is also a modal that displays the correct answer after the user answers the questions.
